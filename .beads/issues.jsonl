Create new Blade partial: resources/views/heatmap/partials/movie-stats-today.blade.php\n2. Move the stats HTML (lines 92-99) from controller string to Blade template\n3. Update controller to render the partial with clickCount data\n4. Maintain HTMX OOB swap functionality with id=\"movie-stats-today\"\n5.
